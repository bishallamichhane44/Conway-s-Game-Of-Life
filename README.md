# Conway's Game of Life

This repository contains an implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by British mathematician John Horton Conway. The game  evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

## About

The universe of the Game in this case is Bounded, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. 

## Installation
